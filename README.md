A simple to do list used to keep track of daily or weekly tasks. Comes complete with a built in clock, a due date generated based on priority level, and a count down timer that counts down to the due date. 4 columns exist where each task gets sorted based on the following conditions: "added but not started", "started but not completed", "completed" , and "past due". These are auto sorted for you based on the status of each task. This app is also mobile friendly and can be used on any mobile device.
